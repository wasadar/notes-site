# Notes Site

This is a web application that allows users to create and edit notes. It is built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Except React there also was used Redux.

I made this app as my pet project to practice in deploying projects and using React and Redux libraries.

## Features

- Users can create, update, delete and sort notes.
- All data is saved in the user's local storage so the app don't store or share any user's data.
